# MedicineManagement
This is the application to manage the time we take medicine.

It is not finished yet and going to be improved in some time.

We can add the medicine we take by entering the data (name, photo, dose, etc.)

We can also set the time we need notification.

Now working on google maps to show the nearest hospital in different symptoms. Also, the added calendar system will be updated for convenience. In the future, hopefully going to have the medicine searching function and account setting.
